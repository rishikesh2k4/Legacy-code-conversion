# Legacy Code Conversion: Delphi → Python

A project built during the **EG Company Hackathon – Mangalore**, where our team stood among the **top 25 out of 120+ teams**. The challenge? Modernize legacy codebases. Our solution — an AI-powered translator that converts **Delphi** code to **Python** using a fine-tuned **GPT-2** model.


## 🚀 Overview

Legacy code slows innovation. Manual rewriting is expensive and time-consuming. Our project presents an **automated approach** using **deep learning**, where a fine-tuned GPT-2 model translates Delphi code into modern Python equivalents — intelligently, and efficiently.



## 💡 Problem Statement

> **Modernize legacy software codebases by converting outdated languages to modern programming languages.**

We focused on **Delphi to Python** translation — replacing outdated systems with modern, readable, and efficient code using a **data-driven, model-based** approach instead of traditional rule-based parsers.


## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- HuggingFace Transformers  
- PyTorch  
- GPT-2 (Pretrained & Fine-tuned)  
- Google Colab (for training)  
- CUDA-enabled GPU (for acceleration)  



## 📦 Features

- Fine-tunes GPT-2 for Pascal → Python code translation  
- Real-time CLI tool to input legacy code & get Python output  
- Custom tokenizer with Delphi-specific special tokens  
- Handles long code with chunking logic  
- Auto-formats Python code output  


## 🏁 Summary

This prototype shows how AI can assist in legacy software modernization. Though in its early stage, it:
	•	Reduces human effort
	•	Enhances consistency
	•	Opens the door for AI-based refactoring tools

We believe this approach could reshape how industries tackle massive, outdated codebases — and we’re just getting started.


## ✨ Team
