# 🧠 Legacy code conversion from Delphi to Python code

 
 A project developed during the **EG Company Hackathon in Mangalore**, where our team was selected among the **top 25 out of 120+ teams**. The challenge was to **modernize legacy code** — and we tackled it by building a custom solution that **translates Delphi (Pascal) code into Python** using a fine-tuned GPT-2 language model.

## 🚀 Overview

This project fine-tunes the GPT-2 model on Pascal-to-Python code translation examples and provides an interactive prompt where users can input legacy Pascal code and get equivalent Python code as output.

---

## 💡 Problem Statement

> **"Modernize legacy software codebases by converting outdated languages to modern programming languages."**

We chose to convert **Delphi** code to **Python**, using a deep learning-based approach rather than rule-based parsers.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python
- PyTorch
- HuggingFace Transformers
- GPT-2 (Pretrained & Fine-tuned)
- Google Colab (for training)
- CUDA (GPU support)

---

## 📦 Features

- Fine-tuning GPT-2 on code translation tasks
- Real-time interactive CLI to convert Pascal to Python
- Custom tokenizer with special tokens
- Chunk-based long-input handling
- Automatic formatting of generated Python output

## 🏁 Summary

This project showcases how legacy Delphi code can be modernized using a language-model-based approach. While it's an early prototype, it opens the door to automating legacy software migrations using AI.
