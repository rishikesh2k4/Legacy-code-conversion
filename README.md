# 🧠 Legacy Code Conversion: Delphi → Python

A project built during the **EG Company Hackathon – Mangalore**, where our team stood among the **top 25 out of 120+ teams**. The challenge? Modernize legacy codebases. Our solution — an AI-powered translator that converts **Delphi (Pascal)** code to **Python** using a fine-tuned **GPT-2** model.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Legacy code slows innovation. Manual rewriting is expensive and time-consuming. Our project presents an **automated approach** using **deep learning**, where a fine-tuned GPT-2 model translates Delphi code into modern Python equivalents — intelligently, and efficiently.

## 💡 Problem Statement

> **Modernize legacy software codebases by converting outdated languages to modern programming languages.**

We focused on **Delphi to Python** translation — replacing outdated systems with modern, readable, and efficient code using a **data-driven, model-based** approach instead of traditional rule-based parsers.
